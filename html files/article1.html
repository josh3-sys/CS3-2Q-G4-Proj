			<div class="article-content">
				<p>Climate change is no longer an issue, but a global emergency that requires everyone's attention now. The overheating and the resulting changed weather conditions experienced now are due to the combined human activities that emit bad greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere. These gasses are carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, which trap heat from the sun and warm the planet, interfering with ecosystems. While its causes are natural, human action has speeded up climate change to alarming proportions.</p>
				<h2>1. Energy Generation and Industrial Emissions</h2>
				<div>The most important cause of climate change is the burning of fossil fuels—coal, oil, and natural gas. They are used vastly in electricity generation, industrial processes, and heating. When combusted, they emit huge volumes of CO₂, the chief greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. Power plants, refineries, and factories all over the world continue running without much thought to long-range environmental damage, feeding both economic growth and climate destruction. Growth in energy consumption alone, especially in industrialized countries, has resulted in an exponential growth curve in emissions.`</div>
				<h2>2. Transportation: An Increasing Source of Pollution</h2>
				<div>Millions of cars, buses, trucks, and airplanes travel across the globe every day, releasing CO₂ as well as many other contaminants. Transportation is among the biggest emitters of greenhouse gases; burning fossil fuel in vehicles produces massive amounts of carbon. The higher demand for more goods, services, and traveling in this interactive world make transportation even highly important but it is the largest contributor to global warming. Planes and ships, which transport people and goods across the international borders, are major culprits, releasing pollutants high in the atmosphere over hundreds of miles.</div>
				<h2>3. Agricultural Practices: Methane and Nitrous Oxide Emissions</h2>
				<div>Another influential sector in climate change is agriculture. Because feeding the world's ever-expanding population is an important objective, particular agricultural activities prove to be significant contributors to the overall greenhouse gas emissions. Livestock farming is a significant contributor and major producer of methane, or CH4, one of the most potent greenhouse gases, often released through digestion and from manure management. Yet another source of methane is the cultivation of rice, due to the extremely favorable environment which prevails in flooded rice paddies for methane-producing microbes. In addition, nitrogen fertilizers are the most widely applied type of fertilizer and these fertilizers result in the emission of nitrous oxide (N₂O), a gas which has a strength thousands of times greater than CO₂ in the trapping of heat in the atmosphere.</div>
				<h2>4. Deforestation: Depleting the Planet's Carbon Sinks</h2>
				<div>Through natural means, forests act as carbon sinks by uptaking the CO₂ existing in the atmosphere and thus curbing the emission of greenhouse gases. However, deforestation, especially in the tropics, has remained one of the leading causes of climate change. Trees have a lot of carbon that finds its way into the atmosphere when the trees are cut or cleared. Such levels of greenhouse gases rise in the atmosphere due to the accelerated rate of deforestation. Normally, deforestation leads to agriculture or urban growth. Not only does this destruction of forests increase the amount of emissions but also the possibility of CO₂ absorption by the Earth reduces in this process-it becomes a vicious circle.</div>
				<h2>5. Buildings and Urban Development</h2>
				<div>Buildings where we live and work contribute to climate change. The amount of energy consumed for heating, cooling, and lighting in homes, offices, and commercial spaces further fuels the consumption of fossil fuels. With the ever-growing and expanding urban hubs, energy required increases unscrupulously without even a thought for sustainable design and renewable sources of energy. In addition, urban centers have very few green spaces for adequate absorption of CO₂ and imparting cooling effects. The more a city expands, the higher the levels of energy consumption which aggravates the situation further in respect of climatic change.</div>
